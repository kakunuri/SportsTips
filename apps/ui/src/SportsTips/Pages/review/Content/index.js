      infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Most people
      who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and
      recover without special treatment.In mathematics, the corona theorem is a
      result about the spectrum of the bounded holomorphic functions on the open
      unit disc, conjectured by Kakutani (1941) and proved by Lennart Carleson
      (1962). The commutative Banach algebra and Hardy space H∞ consists of the
      bounded holomorphic functions on the open unit disc D. Its spectrum S (the
      closed maximal ideals) contains D as an open subspace because for each z
      in D there is a maximal ideal consisting of functions f with f(z) = 0. The
      subspace D cannot make up the entire spectrum S, essentially because the
      spectrum is a compact space and D is not. The complement of the closure of
      D in S was called the corona by Newman (1959), and the corona theorem
      states that the corona is empty, or in other words the open unit disc D is
      dense in the spectrum. A more elementary formulation is that elements
      f1,...,fn generate the unit ideal of H∞ if and only if there is some δ>0
      such that cdots everywhere in the unit ball. Newman showed that the corona
      theorem can be reduced to an interpolation problem, which was then proved
      by Carleson. In 1979 Thomas Wolff gave a simplified (but unpublished)
      proof of the corona theorem, described in (Koosis 1980) and (Gamelin
      1980). Cole later showed that this result cannot be extended to all open
      Riemann surfaces (Gamelin 1978). As a by-product, of Carleson's work, the
      Carleson measure was invented which itself is a very useful tool in modern
      function theory. It remains an open question whether there are versions of
      the corona theorem for every planar domain or for higher-dimensional
      domains. Note that if one assume the continuity up to the boundary in
      Corona's theorem, then the conclusion follows easily from the theory of
